            <p>This is the city of Irvine which is within minutes of where 
                i live here in Southern California. Irvine is  hidden gem in 
                the tech world.The city's unique vibe attracts some of the 
                brightest minds. Blizzard Entertainment, Broadcom and Alteryx 
                are just some of the leading technology companies headquartered
                in Irvine. Vizio, Cylance and Lantronix are a few other well known 
                firms in this field. Games, semiconductors, data analytics and other
                fields are just a few of the many that these IT firms specialize in.
                My eyes are on this area as i move toward graduating from Coding Temple.
